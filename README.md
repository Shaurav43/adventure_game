# Adventure Game

 * Nanodegree: Intro to Programming
 * Module: Intro to Python

## Project Summary

The project is a text based adventure game.

## Main technologies

* Python

## Project Requirements

* Descriptions are printed to the console for the player to see.
* The `time.sleep` function is used to create delays between messages so that they aren't all printed at once.
* The `random.choice` or `random.randint` function is used to influence the game so that each game is different in some way.
* The input function is used to ask the player what they would like to do.
* The player's choices affect what happens in the game, including:
  * Whether the player wins or loses
  * Whether to restart or exit after the game is over
* If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until they enter a valid option.
* The game does not crash and does not treat invalid input as a valid choice.
* The code includes at least four function definitions that are used to improve the code in some way, such as by:
  * Reducing repetition
  * Reducing complexity
  * Improving the readability or organization of the code
* Each function should have a single purpose and a name that describes that purpose.
* The `pycodestyle` tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.
* The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.
