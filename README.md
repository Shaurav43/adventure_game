What Is This?
This is a simple Python application intended to provide a working example of a text based adventure game.

Random is used to set the random choice of events and numbers.

I've put in a separate file "words.py" so that when anyone wants to add any of the weapons, scenario, monsters we can simply add or delete from the file.
